# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
BikeSharing/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
BikeSharing/db/*.sqlite3
BikeSharing/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
BikeSharing/log/*
BikeSharing/tmp/*
